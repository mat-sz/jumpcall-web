            The service's intention is providing you with a way to transfer
            small files (excluding files prohibited by the Terms of Service)
            between devices over your local network or via the provided TURN

            Actions that will result in a termination of your access to the
            service include, but are not limited to:

              <li>

              <li>using the service to transfer excessive amounts of data,</li>
              <li>using the service to distribute malware,</li>
              <li>
                using the service's TURN server for activities unrelated to the

            The service does not store any user data on the servers. WebRTC
            connections are end-to-end encrypted according to the WebRTC
            specification and no actions will be taken by the service to decrypt
            the contents (in case of the packets being relayed by the service's
            TURN servers). Metadata related to file transfers (such as file
            name, file size and file type) is not permanently stored and is
            removed from the server's memory after the transfer is complete.
          </li>
          <li>
            No cookies will be stored on your device. Every session uses a newly
            generated client identifier which will be destroyed once the session
            is over and will not be used to track the user.
          </li>
          <li>
            The service is provided free of charge and no warranty is given. The
            service's provider is not liable for any damage caused by the usage
            of the service.
          </li>
          <li>
            The service's owner reserves the right to take the service down for
            any reason (including no reason being given) temporarily and/or
            permanently. The service's owner is not obligated to continue
            providing the service.

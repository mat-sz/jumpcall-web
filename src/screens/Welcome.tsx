          Welcome to {process.env.REACT_APP_TITLE}! Let me explain what this
          website is.
        </p>
        <p>
          This website allows you to copy files over the network (LAN if both
          devices are on the same local network and support WebRTC, otherwise
          the traffic goes through a TURN relay). Originally I've created this
          project to avoid logging into my e-mail on computers I don't own or
          having to type long URLs by hand. I hope it is as useful for you as it
          is for me. :)
        </p>
        <p>
          You can start a file transfer in a few easy steps:
          <ol>
            <li>Open this website on one device (you're here right now!)</li>
            <li>
              Scan the QR code or open the URL from the "Invite" section on
              another device.
            </li>
            <li>
              Drag and drop your files onto a tile (any tile that isn't marked
              as "You", you can also click on a tile to open a file selection
              dialog).
            </li>
            <li>Accept the transfer on another device.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
